		<h3 class="subtitle">Why learn web design</h3>
		<p>The Internet has drastically changed the way we live, work and communicate with each other. Consequently, web development has become a fundamental skill complementary to multiple disciplines. Web development is becoming an essential skill. Meanwhile, I find publishing and hosting my own website very fasinating. Therefore, I decide to have the web design course.</p>

		<h3 class="subtitle">The websites I visit most often</h3>
		<a href="http://www.baidu.com">Baidu</a>
		<p>It is the best search engine available in China. I use it for a diversity of purposes, including studying, programming, entertaining, searching game strategies,etc. However, I sometimes dislike it for its advertisements in searching results.</p>
